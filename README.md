🚀 # SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## 🌌 Project Overview
SpaceX has revolutionized the rocket launch industry by reusing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rockets, reducing costs to $62 million per launch compared to competitors charging up to $165 million. In this project, we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land, providing valuable insights into cost estimation and competitive strategies for other organizations.

By analyzing data and building predictive models, we unlock the potential to forecast landing success and explore the future of cost-efficient space exploration.

## 🎯 # Key Objectives

### 🔎 Collect raw data from SpaceX APIs and web pages.
### 🛠️ Prepare and wrangle data for analysis.
### 📊 Perform SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA).
### 📈 Visualize key insights using interactive dashboards.
### 🤖 Build machine learning models to predict landing outcomes.
